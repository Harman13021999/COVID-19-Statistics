In the COVID-19-Statistics project, I downloaded the COVID-19 data from the World Health Organization's website and first cleaned it a bit in the Excel sheet itself.
After that I imported the excel sheet into MySQL server for the detail analysis of it. The code contains different further SQL queries for different scenarios we can see
within the data.
